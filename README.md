An Example
==========

Let's say you're in an IRC channel named #push and it has the initial topic "clear". PushBot
can help organize a push queue.

                                           TOPIC: clear
      alice> .join                         TOPIC: alice
        bob> .join with alice              TOPIC: alice + bob
    pushbot> alice, bob: You're up         TOPIC: alice + bob
        bob> .good                         TOPIC: alice + bob*
      alice> .good                         TOPIC: alice* + bob*
    pushbot> alice, bob: Everyone is ready TOPIC: alice* + bob*
      carol> .join                         TOPIC: alice* + bob* | carol
      alice> .at preprod                   TOPIC: <preprod> alice + bob | carol
      alice> .good                         TOPIC: <preprod> alice* + bob | carol
        bob> .good                         TOPIC: <preprod> alice* + bob* | carol
    pushbot> alice, bob: Everyone is ready TOPIC: <preprod> alice* + bob* | carol
      alice> .at prod                      TOPIC: <prod> alice + bob | carol
      alice> .good                         TOPIC: <prod> alice* + bob | carol
       dave> .join                         TOPIC: <prod> alice* + bob | carol + dave
        bob> .good                         TOPIC: <prod> alice* + bob* | carol + dave
    pushbot> alice, bob: Everyone is ready TOPIC: <prod> alice* + bob* | carol + dave
      alice> .done                         TOPIC: carol + dave
    pushbot> carol, dave: You're up        TOPIC: carol + dave


Configuring PushBot For Your Handle
===================================

You can modify a few settings within PushBot with respect to your IRC handle.

* You can tell PushBot to try to be quiet when you're driving
* You can have PushBot send you Notifo notifications when you're at the head of the queue

To configure PushBot, head to http://[pushbot-hostname]:8080/

Tricks For Suppressing Pushbot Topic Change Spam
================================================

### Colloquy

Edit the CSS for your chosen style. If you're using "DecafBland - Inverted", for instance, you should open the file

    /Applications/Colloquy.app/Contents/Resources/Styles/DecafBland.colloquyStyle/Contents/Resources/Variants/Inverted.css

and add the line

    .event { display: none; }

That'll get rid of all event messages (joins, parts, topic changes), and could be too much, so you might want to make a variant of your style just for #push.

### Limechat

Edit the CSS for your chosen style, for instance

    /Applications/LimeChat.app/Contents/Themes/Limelight.css

and add the lines

    html[channelname="#push"] div[type=topic] {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        padding-left: 0 !important;
        background: #000;
        width: 100%;
    }

That'll move all topics in the #push channel to a line on the top of the channel, with new topics covering up old topics.

### IRSSI

    /ignore -channels #push * TOPICS

### WeeChat

    /filter add hush_pushbot irc.host.#push irc_topic pushbot
